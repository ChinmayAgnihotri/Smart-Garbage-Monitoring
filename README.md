# Smart-Garbage-Monitoring
The Internet of Things (IoT), is expected to be involved in the infrastructure for the envisioned concept of a Smart City, bringing new possibilities for the city management. IoT vision introduces promising and economical solutions for massive data collection and its analysis which can be applied in many domains and so make them operate more efficiently. Normally there is one of the most challenging issues - municipal waste-collection within the Smart City. To optimize the logistic procedure of waste collection, this system can be a prototype. The level of garbage in the dustbin is monitored by real time data to the client. 


For this project, I have used NodeMCU, an open-source IOT platform. I preferred using the NodeMCU over Arduino since it a cost effective option with built in WiFi capabilities.
Along with NodeMCU, I have used two sensors. An ultrasonic sensor to determine the level of garbage in the container, and an MQ2 sensor to detect hazardous waste.
For the database, I have used Firebase as it was most the suited to connect to multiple sensors and the Android app. 

To build this project, the classical iterative waterfall model was followed: phases consisting of feasibility study, requirement analysis, design, coding, unit testing, integration, system testing and maintenace were executed, all in a continuous feedback loop.
